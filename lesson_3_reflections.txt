When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?

- To collaborate with others
- For cloud storage and backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- To ensure that only the approritate files are committed

Describe difference between fork, clone, and branch. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are created within a repository and are used to create new code lines for new features.
Clones are used to replicate a repository on your local computer or on GitHub.
Forks is a GitHub feature used to replicate a repository. 
Forks allow:
	- Others to replicate a repository without changing the original repository.
	- GitHub to track number of 'forks' created from a GitHub repository
	- Other to provide feedback to the author of the original repository on GitHub.

What is the beneift of having the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Helps detect when the repository stored locally is our of synch with the GitHub respository.
If changes are made to the local or GitHub respository independently, having the last known
state of the remote can be detected and conflicts resolved.
